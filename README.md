CarnEvil knights is an adventure game where the hero (The Knight) fights the invaded ghosts and zombies. As the hero progresses, they must jump over obstacles and shoot the incoming enemies with their special ammunition (Bow and Arrow). The scores will be scored in a database, which is kept in the server side along with the player ID. The client side will display the scores as a multiplayer game.
